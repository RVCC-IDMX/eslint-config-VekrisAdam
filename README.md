# Learning semi in eslint
## Let's Learn an ESLint Rule

#### semi is a rule that can be implemented with the linter known as ESLint. The rule can be used to prevent unwanted code changes that can be caused by ASI and set a consistent style by enforcing the consistent placement of semi-colons. ASI (automatic semi-colon insertion) is a mechanism of the JavaScript engine that can sometimes misinterpret where semi-colons should be placed and, as a result, makes your code have semi-colons in unintended spots and so function differently than how you wrote it. To prevent ASI from causing these problems, semi can be set-up to allow semi-colons at the end of statements with the "always" and "error" options, and disallow semi-colons at the end of statements with the "never" option.
